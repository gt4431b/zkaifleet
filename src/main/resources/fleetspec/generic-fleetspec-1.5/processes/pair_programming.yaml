description: Git-centric collab with consensus (0.7 threshold), confidence scoring to prevent gridlock.
steps:
  - agent: R2D2
    action: implementInitial
    details: Pull branch; TDD in-memory; commit; push/notify C3PO; create codePoint/tddTest wrunks.
  - agent: C3PO
    action: reviewIterate
    details: Pull; re-run TDD; if consensus (0.7 diff) and confidence >0.7, merge; else escalate. Detect gridlock via wrunk patterns (>3 cycles).
output: Merged code; log wrunks.
tddHandling: In-memory REPL; CI on push.
evolutionNotes: RDF for anomaly detection; hybrid Option 2 if costs allow.
